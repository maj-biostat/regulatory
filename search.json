    "section": "Key principles",
    "text": "Key principles\nThese are critical considerations in any adaptive trial.\n\nAdequacy within the development program\nTrials should build upon evidence moving from exploratory to confirmatory stages. In the confirmatory setting, adaptations shoud be limited. The key idea is that adaptation should not be used to completely replace the exploratory phase. For example, if dose-ranging has not been conducted then dose selection within a confirmatory setting is not well founded.\n\n\nAdequacy of planning\nPredictably, the planning considerations that need to be specified for adaptive trials include:\n\nnumber of interim analyses\ntiming of interim analyses\ntypes of adaptations\nmethods to be used for interim analyses\nrules governing adaptations\nmethods for the primary analysis aligned to the targeted estimand\napproaches to maintain trial integrity\n\nUnblinded adaptation is raised as a particular risk that needs to be managed and simulations are raised, especially their documentation. An interesting point is that the planning stage should involve the IDMC to confirm their understanding and support so that the panel is able to review interim results and make adaptation recommendations. A key point is specification of whether rules are to be binding or not. Non-binding rules are potentially useful where flexibility is needed to deal with safety issues, but the trial specification needs to be clear about how permissive deviations can be and what leads to them. Again, clarity in the specification is emphasised.\n\n\nMinimise errors\nThe section deals with error control, mainly minimising false positive efficacy conclusions within a frequentist framework but also false negatives (related to power). The discussion raises both type-i and multiplicity adjustments and refers the reader on to ICH E9 for consideration of when non-frequentist approaches can be used. Nothing much further of note.\n\n\nReliability\nThis section basically considers with bias and variability of the effect estimates.\nOne of the considerations that is pointed out relates to selecting treatment arms from a multi-arm design on the basis of the largest effects as this can lead to over estimation of the effect. Another point is how secondary endpoints may be biased in the presence of adaptation, but there wasn’t any detail on this.\n\n\nTrial integrity\nThis section is quite a bit longer than the others. The central goal of trial integrity is to ensure that the objectives are met in a reliable, ethical and timely manner.\nAllocation concealment and blinding are raised, as is ensuring that summaries of accumalating data are controlled so that expectations and behaviours are not impacted. As an example, enrolment rates might be impacted through careless handling of data, especially if effect sizes based on the accruing data are small (and therefore interpreted as no effect). Ideally, everyone is blinded to individually treatment assignment and accumulating summary level data. If blinding is not possible for everyone then the personnel that have access to accumulating data should at least be independent in the sense that they do not have any role in trial activities.",

    "section": "Types of adaptation",
    "text": "Types of adaptation\nThis section deals with some of the key adaptations that might be encountered.\n\nEarly stopping\nThe main points that are made in this section are:\n\nappropriate control of type-i error\ntiming analyses so that if stopping occurs, the results would be sufficiently persuasive\nlogistical considerations (DSMC availability)\nensuring that sufficient data accrues for meaningful secondary and safety outcomes (and subgroups)\n\nThese all point to ensuring that interim analyses do not start too early and having solid justification for the stopping rule (e.g. ethics).\nWith regards to the use of the data, the guidance indicates that two versions of the final analysis should be presented, the first based on the data to the time that the decision was triggered and the second that is based on that data plus any that continued to accrue due to delays between the decision being reached and suspension of enrolment. Clearly, this leads to the possibility of contradicting or revised results and these instances need to be assessed and explained in the reporting to ensure that the results are interpretable.\nFutility rules are recommended to be non-binding and thus type-i should be controlled in independent of these rule types.\n\n\nSample size adaptation\nSample size adapatation is where the initial sample size calculation is revisited based on the accruing data. Many times people think early stopping is sample size adaptation, it isn’t. The goal with sample size adapatation is to ensure that sufficient power is available to address the trial goals, in light of the uncertainty that is resolved on design parameters. In practice, for researcher led trials, this isn’t a very practical adapatation element.\nWithin this adaptation, trial integrity should be considered such that re-estimation is undertaken blinded to treatment assignment.\n\n\nPopulation selection\nOtherwise known as enrichment, conceives an adaptation rule based on treatment effect heterogeneity across population strata. For example, if effects are identified to be present in older but not younger cohorts, we might focus subsequent enrolment on the older cohort. Care needs to be taken against bias as cohorts are based on treatment effects and that the approach is based on a scientific rationale for the existence of heterogeneity.\nThis adaptation has implications on the analysis approach, which should shift to be primarily focused on the enriched population, although all of the data should still be used (pooled).\n\n\nTreatment selection\nMulti-arm trials may involve considerations to adapt based on arm performance with only better arms continuing over the entire study (e.g. as in dose selection). In this setting flexibile rules are recommended to allow for the full scope of information to be assessed. The guidance indicates that methods to reduce bias should be considered, but is silent on what methods might be used.\n\n\nParticipant allocation\nThe section focuses on RAR and covariate adapted allocation. The challenges of RAR are discussed, particularly inflation of type-i and the potential for bias in the presence of time trends. For example, a RAR design would be more likely to show a false positive if earlier-enrolled participants are both more likely to be assigned to control and to have a poor prognosis (e.g., because of changes in background care or participant characteristics over time) than later-enrolled participants. An additional concern is how sample size might be overly restricted in some arms to the point where inference is challenging.\nIf RAR is to be used, the specific RAR procedure should be specified and justified which includes accounting for time trends. One approach is to restrict RAR to a single or small number of interim analyses.\nThe logistical and trial integrity considerations are disussed. Specifically, allocation updates should be maintained confidentially so that information on treatment effects is not revealed.\nFinally, deterministic rules for RAR are strongly discouraged.",

    "section": "Special topics",
    "text": "Special topics\n\nData monitoring\nThe IDMC for adaptive designs should have the expertise required to make informed decisions for these kinds of trials. They need to have at least one statistician that are experienced in the area of adaptive designs and a charter needs to be produced in order to guide the IDMC (meeting schedule, logistics, confidentiality procedures, process for making recommendations).\nWithin the trial team, the set of analysts responsible for implementing the interim analyses should be carved out and these should not be members of the monitoring committee. Ideally, these analysts would be independent from the sponsor.\nWhen the IDMC makes a recommendation then information may be communicated to the sponsor to allow them to make the final call on whether the trial should be stopped. Again, any unblinding should be carefully considered.\n\n\nSimulations\nThis appeared to be the largest section in the document.\nWhat simulations are and their intended goals are discussed along with how much detail (e.g. addressing missingness or not) should be implemented and their merit in comparing adaptive versus fixed designs.\nIn terms of setting up a simulation, the guidance indicates that the focus and objectives should be thought through up front. This includes the selection of a benchmark design and analysis approach that should be a well-understood design.\nOptions for variations across simulations may look at number and timing of interim analyses, types of adaptations, stopping rules and testing procedures. Nuisance parameters are raised as a key consideration.\nThe operating characteristics to be reported include type-i, expected sample size, trial duration, power, coverage, bias, mean squared error of treatment effect, cumulative stopping probabilities. Different summary statistics for each might have merit.\nThe assumptions for the simulations should be founded ideally on real data (e.g. published sources) rather than opinion.\nThe implementation details for the simulations need to be described and justified, which includes the data-generating process, model specification number of simulations per scneario sufficient for the desired precision of summary statistics. The design, results and conclusions of the simulation study need to be documented. Include:\n\nKey questions to be addressed\nClinical trial design and analysis options to be evaluated\nChoice of operating characteristics to be assessed\nExisting knowledge used to inform simulations\nRange of parameter configurations used along with justification\nImplementation details (DGP, number of trials per simulation)\nSoftware and code used along with detailed instructions on how to recreate simulations\nSummary of results, interpretation and conclusions\nExample trials\nLimitations of the simulation results\nClinical discussion on the extent to which the simulations address key questions\n\nThe guidance strongly emphasises the documentation requirements.\n\n\nBayesian methods\nThe guidance doesn’t include anything surprising under this section. Borrowing information is explicitly discussed, specifically, the use of informative priors, the use of external data. Priors are still a point of contention and the need for justification is strongly stated. Sensitivity analyses are recommended.\nStragely, partial-pooling and the use of hierarchical models isn’t mentioned.\n\n\nTime to event studies\nFor time to event studies, the focus of events rather than number of participants is a key consideration. As such, adaptive designs based on time to event endpoints might (and probably should) be evaluated with respect to events rather than target sample sizes. This flows over into the types of adaptations that might be considered; sample size re-estimation becomes number-of-events re-estimation etc. Adaptations should rely on the primary endpoint (not secondary markers which can violate the independence assumption). In general, the participants that inform interim analyses should only be those that have reached their endpoint.\n\n\nExploratory trials\nThe section highlights that exploratory trials can (relative to confirmatory trials) incorporate more adaptations. This is specifically geared towards early stage trials.\n\n\nOperational aspects\nOne of the main aspects of this section disussed the need to minimise information transfer so that things don’t creep out of the interim results and thereby impact trial integrity. Another aspect is the requirement to be clear with participants about the possibility of adaptation, why they might happen and the impacts on them.\nInfrastructure requirements is another key point.",
